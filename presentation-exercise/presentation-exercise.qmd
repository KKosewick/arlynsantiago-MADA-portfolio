title: "Presentation Exercise"

## Data visualization

For this exercise I chose a graph from the "Hereâ€™s What Your Part Of America Eats On Thanksgiving" article from FiveThirtyEight (<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/>). The graph displays the side dishes commonly consumed per region in the United States on Thanksgiving. I used the RTutor AI online tool to make the graph more similar the original one.

This is the original graph from the article:

![Caption](side-dish.webp)\

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(here)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

dishes_poll <- read_csv(here("presentation-exercise","thanksgiving-2015-poll-data.csv"))

str(dishes_poll) #I used str() to see what the dataset looked like once I loaded it into RStudio

```

Most of the variables are character variables. There are 1058 observations and 65 variables in this dataset.

I will first create a column related to side dishes response, filter out NA values, and then attempt to create a table. I had to create a seperate column because after many attempts I realized each dish had its own column which isn't efficient for 1050 observations to pick from. 

```{r}
dishes_poll_dif <- dishes_poll %>%
  unite("side_dish", 12:26, sep =',',na.rm = TRUE)

side_dishes_columns <- grep("Which of these side dishes aretypically served at your Thanksgiving dinner? Please select all that apply.", names(dishes_poll), value = TRUE)


tab1 <- dishes_poll %>%
  count('US Region', 'Which of these side dishes aretypically served at your Thanksgiving dinner? Please select all that apply. - Brussel sprouts`== "Brussel sprouts"')

gtsummary::tbl_summary(dishes_poll,
                       by = `US Region`)
```

I will now attempt to create the same graph from the article using ggplot(). I will first have to filter by the question "Do you celebrate Thanksgiving" and then use count() to select for the US region and the dished served at Thanksgiving. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

popular_dishes_by_region <- dishes_poll %>%
  filter(`Do you celebrate Thanksgiving?` == "Yes") %>%
  count(`US Region`, `What is typically the main dish at your Thanksgiving dinner?`) %>%
  arrange(`US Region`, desc(n))

ggplot(popular_dishes_by_region, aes(x = reorder(`What is typically the main dish at your Thanksgiving dinner?`, n), y = n, fill = `US Region`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Main Dish", y = "Count", fill = "Region") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~`US Region`, scales = "free_y")

```

This is honestly the best I could do, I'm not sure how the author was able to group all these graphs so neatly into one.
