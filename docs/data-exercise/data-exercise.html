<p>This exercise is designed to give you practice with exploring text datasets (a <em>complex data type</em>). We will load, process, and engage in some discriptive/exploratory analysis of the data.</p>
<p>The data this week comes from the appa R package created by Avery Robbins. The original data came from the Avatar Wiki, and the example code used to scrape this dataset is also covered on Avery’s blog along with a quick exploration of the available data in a separate blog post.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I will need these packages but I will load them all just to be sure</p>

We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?

[Yawns and stretches.] Yep, a man needs his rest. [After a short pause, he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly, his tone tired.] Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

[Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle.] Power in firebending comes from the breath [Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion.], not the muscles. [He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast.] The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! [Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him.] Get it right this time.

[He sits down again on his chair.] You have yet to master your basics. [He yells his order.] Drill it again!

On a dire tone.] Very well, [His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground.] but first, I must finish my roast duck.

After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. [Yawns.] And I'm still tired. [He falls off one of the horses. He is quickly picked back up.

Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. [Excitedly.] Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.

Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.

[Flashback quickly ends.] He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.
76  That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. [Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.] When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. [Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.] Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. [Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.] Zuko would have to duel his own father.

After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.

A man needs his rest.

We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.  I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.  Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?

Yep, a man needs his rest.  Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles.  The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!  Get it right this time.

19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Remember your firebending basics,  Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Basics, Zuko!  Break his root!
22                                                                                                                                                                                    No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory.  So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat?  Disgraceful.  Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.  Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Okay then.  We have no idea where he is.
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You really should open a window in here.
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Are you going to finish that?
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Over here!
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Very well!
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Who's there?  A meadow vole! I should have known.  You startled me, little one.  It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Where are you taking me?
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Right, but where, specifically?
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired.  And I'm still tired.
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Nothing.  Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.

The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.

42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?  What if you're caught?
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We're on a collision course!
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Even more urgent. It seems, I-  -I have lost my lotus tile.
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
53                                                                                                                                           See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.  Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.  I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for  is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.  Oh, this place looks promising!  Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yeah, it kind of is.
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's no proverb!
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Maybe it should be a proverb ...
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!

A big one.

I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.

He's just all worked up.

Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.

May I join you?

My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.

72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Very well. But you must promise not to speak. &nbsp;These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zuko was right, you see, &nbsp;but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences.
75                                                                                                                                                                                                After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.  He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.
76  That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood.  When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general.  Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.  Zuko would have to duel his own father.
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I looked away.
79                                                                                                                                                                             It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.

But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!

Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck.
112                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.
113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I hope not, for your sake.
114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?
115                                                                                                                                                                  It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack.  The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.
116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well,  ever since I lost my son ...
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ... I think of you as my own.
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Remove the moon? How?
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   What?
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       He is right Zhao.
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.  Some of its life is in you.
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.
